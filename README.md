# Dishes

The project was completed as a recruitment task in React technology using Typescript. Its main goal was to create a form containing dish name, preparation time, type and also some fields dependent on dish type. The libraries I used were mainly:

- Material UI
- axios
- dayjs
- Lottie
- react-router
- react-hook-form
- styled-components
- validator

## Design

The design of the page is based on a custom mockup created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/cob3pXp7YDv270r1ycB13W/Dishes?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=VfSytdafdQ7wAsGm-1).
